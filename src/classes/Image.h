/**
 Reactively updates the image of an UIImageView whenever the state of its owner changes.
 An Image can be configured with the following options:

  - **showInitials** - A *Boolean* indicating if the owner's personalization should be shown. Defaults to true.
  - **initialsBuilder** - A method that receives the *initials* and *engraving* as Strings and the ImageView that will be used and returns a map with the initials and a profile list. This is the default method:

  ```
     ^NSDictionary *(NSString *initials, NSString *engraving, UIImageView *imageView) {
         NSString *initialsS = initials ?: @"";
         NSArray *profile = engraving != nil ? @[engraving] : @[];
         return @{
            @"initials": initialsS ?: @"",
            @"profile": profile
         };
     };
  ```
